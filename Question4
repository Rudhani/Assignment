1. What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
	Selenium is a portable software testing framework for web applications.
		There are four components of Selenium.
			*Selenium IDE
			*RC
			*WebDriver
			*Grid
	Selenium WebDriver is a collection of open source APIs which are used to automate the testing of a web application.

2. How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
	*To communicate between server and client (browser), selenium web driver uses JSON. 
	*JSON Wire Protocol is a REST API that transfers the information between HTTP servers. 
	*Each Browser Driver has its own HTTP server.
	
3. What are the locators available to find an element using Selenium?
	*By.id: find_element_by_id
	*By.name attribute: find_element_by_name
	*By.class name: find_element_by_class_name
	*By.tag name: find_element_by_tag_name
	*By.link text: find_element_by_link_text
	*By.partial link text: find_element_by_partial_link_text
	*By.cssSelector: find_element_by_css_Selector
	*By.xpath: find_element_by_xpath
	
4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?
	*ID Selenium locators are unique for each element in the DOM. 
	*Since IDs are unique for each element on the page.
	*It is considered the fastest and safest method to locate elements.
	
5. How to select value in dropdown?
	*A dropdown is represented by <select> tag and the options are represented by <option> tag.
	*To select an option with its value we have to use the selectByValue method and pass the value attribute  
	 to the option that we want to select as a parameter to that method.

6. What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
	*Absolute Xpath: It contains the complete path from the Root Element to the desire element.
        *Relative Xpath: This is more like starting simply by referencing the element you want and go from the particular location.
           You use always the Relative Path for testing of an element.
	
7. How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
	
	public class LeafGroundCheckBox {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
		ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html");
		driver.manage().window().maximize();
		
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[1]")).click();
		
		String text=driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[contains(text(),'Selenium')]")).getText();
		String text1="Selenium";
		
		if(text1.equals(text)) {
			System.out.println("True");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("False");
		}
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[8]")).click();
		Thread.sleep(500);
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[9]")).click();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[10]")).click();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[11]")).click();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[12]")).click();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@type='checkbox'])[13]")).click();
		
		driver.close();
	}
}

8. Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager?
	*setProperty manages the initialization of the Chrome driver in the first step.
          setProperty() method forms the basis for test case automation on any browser.
	*WebDriverManager automates the browser setup in the Selenium code. 
	  We just need to add its dependency through Maven or Gradle to download all the necessary drivers.
	 
9. Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
	*Preceding syntax:
	 	XPath: //input[@id = 'u_0_2']//preceding::input
	*Following syntax:
		XPath: //input[@id = 'u_0_r']//following::input 
		
10. How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
	*The getAttribute() method helps to get the value of any attribute of a web element, which is returned as a String. 
	*If an attribute has a Boolean value, the method returns either True or null. 
	*Also, if there is no attribute, the method will return null.
