        Multiple and Hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.
        
3. What are the advantages in inheritance?
        * Code Reusability
        * Easy to maintanance
        * Effective memory management
        
4. example for selenium ?
        Selenium is a open source tool for automation testing.
        Example:   Child Class     /      Parent Class
            * ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
            * ChromiumDriver extends RemoteWebDriver
            * RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver
            * WebDriver extends SearchContext
            * Interface SearchContext
                
5. What is methodOverloading with example?
        In a class Methods have same name with differ in parameters is called method overloading. And method overloading is a compile time polymorphism.
        Example:   System.out.println(x);  =>here we declare multiple datatype for the variable x so it is realtime example for method overloading.
        
6.  What is methodOverriding with example?
        In a package more number of classes with same method name is override from the parent class is known as Method Overriding.
        And this is called as Runtime polymorphism.
        Example:   SetFileDetector();  =>This is used to set the file path for manually download the driver.
