1.Inheritance:
    The behaviour by which the super class method and variable are inherited to the subclass.
    
2.Type of inheritance:
    * Single inheritance
    * Multiplelevel inheritance
    * Multiple inheritance
    * Hierarchical inheritance
    
  3.Advantages of inheritance:
    * Code Reuseability.
    * Easier Maintain.
    * Effective Management
    
  4.Example for selenium:
    * ChromeDriver extends ChromiumDriver
    * ChromiumDriver extends RemoteWebDriver
    * RemoteWebDriver implements WebDriver
    * WebDriver extends SearchContext
    * Interface SearchContext
    
  5.Method Overloading:
    * Same class and same method with different arguments.
    * It is also called compiler polymorphism.
    Eg.println();
    
  6.Method overriding:
    * Different class with same method are called method overriding.
    * It is also superclass is inherited to the childcalss.
    * It is also called run time polymorphism.
    Eg.SetFileDetector
